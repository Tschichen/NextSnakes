Okay, first we take care of your project folder. It will fill up more and more
over time. But in the beginning you need only three Subfolders, that we're going
to create now:

> The 'FASTQ' -folder will contain your sequencing raw-data in a certain strukture
> The 'GENOMES' -folder will contain all needed reference genomes and annotations
> The 'snakes' -folder will be insterted as symlink to this repository copy

For now its enough just to create this three - the Guide will do that for you.
Later we fill them. The best and clearest way to use NextSnkaes would be to
create a Folder 'NextSnakes' where you can store several projects side by side.
But this is up to you, only the existence of the above inside your Project-folder
is really necessary.
