All right, we now establish the core-part of NextSnakes, the ICS-structure.
ICS stands for ID-CONDITION-SETTING and is the way you structure the experiment
you want to analyze.
You can imagine the ICS as a rooted tree, where your configfile contains the
root and you have now three branches, where you can arrange your data.

For example you have a KO experiment with Alzheimer-desease cells comparison
between mouse and human. Samples were taken at three different days. Than you
could arrange your Data like this:

            root             ID      CONDITION     SETTING

                                                 ┌── day1
                                  ┌── Wild-Type ─┼── day2
                                  |              └── day3
              `        ┌── Mouse ─┤
                       |          |              ┌── day1
                       |          └── Knock-Out ─┼── day2
                       |                         └── day3
                       |
        AD-Experiment ─┤
                       |
                       |                         ┌── day1
                       |          ┌── Wild-Type ─┼── day2
                       |          |              └── day3
                       └── Human ─┤
                                  |              ┌── day1
                                  └── Knock-Out ─┼── day2
                                                 └── day3

For identify a certain node or leef in this tree, we use following annotation:

 > Mouse:Wild-Type:day2  or
 > Human:Knock-Out

From now on, we we are going to call such an identifyer an 'ics'. It is important
to understand this structure, because NextSnakes will use it in different places:

1. As file structure to follow for the FASTQ directory, where the ID accordingly
   is the first level.
2. As json-dictionary structure to assign workflows and settings to your data
3. As identifier for your postprocess Analyses, where you probably will choose
   different comparison groups.

Now it's your turn. You have to think about how you want to structure your
experiment in NextSnake and we gonna establish it for your Project.
