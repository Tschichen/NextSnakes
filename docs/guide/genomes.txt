                            > GENOME REFERENCES  <

Now we look at the 'GENOMES'-folder. It has also been created in your Project-
directory. Later the Workflows you involve will find References like GTF- or
FASTA-files here.
NextSnakes implements two features, you need to know about:

 > It can happen, that your data includes multiple organisms, like in the example
   above. For that case NextSnakes needs one subdirectory per organism in
   the GENOMES directory. But even if you only have one organism, the
   subdirectory is necessesary.

 > You can use extensions for your genome-files in case you want to use specific
   genomes for different runs.

To set up all that properly, you have to do four steps:

1. First you have to specify a key-value pair in the configfile that assigns the
   organisms your samples come from to the basename(!) of a FASTA-file.
   The ending '.fa.gz' will NextSnakes append automatically.

   In the configfile it will look like this for example:

                "GENOMES": {
                    "Human": "hg38",
                    "Drosophila": "dm6"
                }

2. Than you have to assign each ics to one Organism, which look like this:

                "SOURCE": {
                    "id": {
                        "condition": {
                            "setting_1": "Human"
                            "setting_2": "Drosophila"
                        }
                    }
                }

3. You assign each ics to an additional identifier, which extends the
   FASTA-file basename.

                "NAME": {
                    "id": {
                        "condition": {
                            "setting_1": ".extended"
                            "setting_2": ".normal"
                        }
                    }
                }

4. And finally you have to specify the sequencing type.

                "SOURCE": {
                    "id": {
                        "condition": {
                            "setting_1": "paired"
                            "setting_2": "unpaired"
                        }
                    }
                }


All in all our Example will leads NextSnakes to following files:

 > /GENOMES/Human/hg38.extended.fa.gz
 > /GENOMES/Drosophila/dm6.normal.fa.gz

Now, let's start with the first step!
