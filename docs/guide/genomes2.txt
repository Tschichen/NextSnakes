Good, before we continue with the next steps you have to understand how the
sections in the configfile work. In principal they assign one or more values to
each of your defined ics. The more you have, the bigger your configfile will be.

Now as you learned the Genome reference assignment needs three sections. You can
see in the following Example how the SOURCE section looks if you have several
ID's and Conditions's:

                "SOURCE": {
                        "DAY_1": {
                            "sick": {
                                "GROUP_1": "Human",
                                "GROUP_2": "Mouse"
                            },
                            "healty": {
                                "GROUP_1": "Human",
                                "GROUP_2": "Mouse"
                            }
                        "DAY_2": {
                            "sick": {
                                "GROUP_1": "Human",
                                "GROUP_2": "Mouse"
                            },
                            "healty": {
                                "GROUP_1": "Human",
                                "GROUP_2": "Mouse"
                            }
                        }
                    }

You can imagine, that it would be an annoying work to set every ics individually.
Therefore in the next steps you will be asked at which level in the ICS-tree
you would like to change the settings.
If you decide to do it per ID the options will be shown only once per id, namely
those from the first ics of this id. The Guide will apply these settings for the
following levels.

Okay, here we go!
