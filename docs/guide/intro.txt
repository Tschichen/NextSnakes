Welcome to NextSnakes, the modular assembler of snakemake and nexflow workflows
centered on a single config file.
NextSnakes provides HTS analysis from sra download, preprocessing and mapping
to postprocessing/analysis and ucsc track generation.

For using NextSnakes you basically have to set up a Project-folder with your
Data and create a Config-file containig all Informations about your Project.

This Guide will help you with how to set up both step by step. At the same time
you will understand how NextSnakes works and how the the config-file is
structured. This is important so that you can read and edit config files more
easily.

Furthermore NextSnakes Projects can be expanded by adding further Workflows.
To do that you can also use this Guide to 'append' workflows or data to an
existing config-file.

The Guide will ask you for about various settings. Whenever you are asked for
several entries, use a comma as separator. Spaces are generally ignored. Most
special characters are unallowed. Quotes will never be necessary, the guide will
will use them only to mark possible entrys in the text

Okay, that's enough for now, let's start!
