                             > SET THE WORKFLOWS <

As expected the configfile contains also one section per workflow you switched
on before. For example the MAPPING section of one(!) ics looks like this:

  "MAPPING": {
               "id": {
                   "condition": {
                       "setting": {
                           "ENV": "star",
                           "BIN": "STAR",
                           "ANNOTATION": "genome_or_other.gff3.gz",
                           "OPTIONS":
                           [
                               {  #indexing options
                                  "--sjdbGTFfeatureExon": "exon",
                                  "--sjdbGTFtagExonParentTranscript": "Parent",
                                  "--genomeSAindexNbases": "13"
                               },
                               {  #mapping options
                                  "--sjdbGTFfeatureExon": "exon",
                                  "--sjdbGTFtagExonParentTranscript": "Parent",
                                  "--outSAMprimaryFlag AllBestScore": ""
                               },
                               "std"
                           ]
                       }
                   }
              }
         }

We will now go through all Workflows and change their Settings just like before.
At this example you can set the ANNOTATION option as well as the 'indexing
options' and 'mapping options'. The rest shouldn't interest you at first.
