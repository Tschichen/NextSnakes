                             > SET THE WORKFLOWS <

As expected the CONFIGFILE contains also one section per WORKFLOW you switched
on before. For example the MAPPING section of one(!) ics looks like this:

  "MAPPING": {
               "id": {
                   "condition": {
                       "setting": {
                           "ENV": "star",
                           "BIN": "STAR",
                           "ANNOTATION": "genome_or_other.gff3.gz",
                           "OPTIONS":
                           [
                               {  #indexing options
                                  "--sjdbGTFfeatureExon": "exon",
                                  "--sjdbGTFtagExonParentTranscript": "Parent",
                                  "--genomeSAindexNbases": "13"
                               },
                               {  #mapping options
                                  "--sjdbGTFfeatureExon": "exon",
                                  "--sjdbGTFtagExonParentTranscript": "Parent",
                                  "--outSAMprimaryFlag AllBestScore": ""
                               },
                               "std"
                           ]
                       }
                   }
              }


We are going to go through all WORKFLOWS and change their settings just like
before. In this example you could set the 'ANNOTATION' option as well as the
'indexing options' and 'mapping options'. The rest shouldn't interest you at
first.
